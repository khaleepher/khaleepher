<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Secure Environment</h3>

Khaleepher ensures a secure coding environment by isolating your development environment from your local machine. It uses containerization technology to prevent conflicts and potential security vulnerabilities.
  
<h3>Configurability</h3>

The Khaleepher environment is highly configurable to suit your project's needs. You can easily customize the development tools, libraries, and configurations by editing the <b>Dockerfile</b> and <b>docker-compose.yml</b> files.

<h2>Dedicated Workspace</h2>

With Khaleepher, you get a dedicated workspace that is free from clutter and distractions. Focus solely on your coding tasks without the interference of unrelated files or applications.

<h2>.Collaboration</h2>

Khaleepher supports collaborative coding by enabling multiple developers to work within the same isolated environment. Share the repository with your team members, and everyone can enjoy a consistent and standardized development setup

<h2>Usage</h2>

1. Activate the Khaleepher environment by running:
   docker-compose up -d

2. This will start the development environment in the background.

Access the environment using your preferred code editor or IDE by connecting to the container. You can find the container ID using:
   docker ps

Then, connect to the container using:
   docker exec -it <container_id> bash

3. Begin coding within the container. Any changes you make will be saved within the container.
